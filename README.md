# Gait Analysis
Capstone Project on Gait recognition and Analysis for Person Identification at PES University by team PW22_DS_06

## Planned Work
* View transformation (This is a major part of the project which would help make it very versatile)

## Ongoing Work
* Writing a robust script for preprocessing images with a 90 degree view
* Using Siamese Twins model to measure the effectiveness in similarity prediction between two gait samples

## Completed Work
* Data acquisition
* Feature engineering
    * Gait Energy Image
    * Change Energy Image
    * Frame Diffrence Energy Image
* Data preprocessing for model training (Done only for images with a 90 Degree view)
* Testing of Siamese-Twins model on a very small subset of data

## Technolgies used
* Python 3.6 - 3.9
* tensorflow_gpu-2.6.0 
* TensorFlow 2.6.0
* Bazel 3.7.2 (Build Tool)
* MSVC 2019 (Compiler)
* cuDNN 8.1
* CUDA 11.2
